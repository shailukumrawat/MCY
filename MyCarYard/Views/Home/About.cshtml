                                    beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire,
                                    that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
                                    blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is
                                    the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly
                                    simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
                                    and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure

                                    other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
